LIBRARIES:
- Under `\i2cdevlib-master_Arduino.zip\i2cdevlib-master\Arduino`, take the `I2Cdev` and `MPU6050` folder and put it in libraries of the Documents\Arduino.
- Install toxiclib libraries in processing or take the 2 folders inside `Toxiclib.zip` and put it in `\Documents\Processing\libraries`
    
NOTE:

Had to uncomment:

```cpp
// uncomment "OUTPUT_TEAPOT" if you want output that matches the
// format used for the InvenSense teapot demo
#define OUTPUT_TEAPOT
```
